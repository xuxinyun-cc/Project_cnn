Images are used for photographic composition classification.
The ground truth labels are described in the ground truth files: 'test_label.txt' and 'train_label.txt'.
In the files, a binary row represent the ground truth information of an image, where corresponding composition labels are set 1, otherwise 0.
The order of composition rules are as follows: rule of thirds(RoT), vertical, horizontal, diagonal, curved, triangle, center, symmetric, and pattern.
